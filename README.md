# Pictures-from-Mars
This app uses Nasa's API to retrieve the latest images with description from Mars. There are some animations to cross dissolve between images, as well as a tap gesture recognizer to show or hide the text view.
You will need to use your own API key for the app to work. You can write it in the Constants folder, under "static var API_KEY = "
